## Tests

1. When you view timeblocks for the day, each timeblock is color coded to indicate where it is in the past (gray), present (red), or future (green).
2. When you click a timeblock, you can type an event.
3. When you click the save button for the timeblock, the text for that event is saved in local storage.
4. When you refresh the page, the saved events persist.
5. When you click the clear planner button, the page reloads and the planner's events clear.
